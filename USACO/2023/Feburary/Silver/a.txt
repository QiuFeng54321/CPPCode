How to solve this problem: 
Bessie has opened a bakery!

In her bakery, Bessie has an oven that can produce a cookie in tC units of time or a muffin in tM units of time (1≤tC,tM≤109). Due to space constraints, Bessie can only produce one pastry at a time, so to produce A cookies and B muffins, it takes A⋅tC+B⋅tM units of time.

Bessie's N (1≤N≤100) friends would each like to visit the bakery one by one. The ith friend will order ai (1≤ai≤109) cookies and bi (1≤bi≤109) muffins immediately upon entering. Bessie doesn't have space to store pastries, so she only starts making pastries upon receiving an order. Furthermore, Bessie's friends are very busy, so the ith friend is only willing to wait ci (ai+bi≤ci≤2⋅1018) units of time before getting sad and leaving.

Bessie really does not want her friends to be sad. With one mooney, she can upgrade her oven so that it takes one less unit of time to produce a cookie or one less unit of time to produce a muffin. She can't upgrade her oven a fractional amount of times, but she can choose to upgrade her oven as many times as she needs before her friends arrive, as long as the time needed to produce a cookie and to produce a muffin both remain strictly positive.

For each of T (1≤T≤100) test cases, please help Bessie find out the minimum amount of moonies that Bessie must spend so that her bakery can satisfy all of her friends.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line contains T, the number of test cases.
Each test case starts with one line containing N, tC, tM. Then, the next N lines each contain three integers ai,bi,ci
.

Consecutive test cases are separated by newlines.
